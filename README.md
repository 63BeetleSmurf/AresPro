# Ares Pro

![Ares Pro Splash](AresPro.WinFormsUi/Resources/splash.png)

This project aims to create a clone of Geeksoft's Zeus Pro wrestling simulator.

Feel free to contribute to this project or fork it and go in your own direction. This is a low priority project for me, pretty much just something to do when I need a break but still want to tinker with something.

## Naming

Zeus was the king of the gods in Greek mythology, with Jupiter being the Roman equivalent. Ares was the son of Zeus, and it happened to be easy to modify the original splash image to say Ares. So that's what I'm going with.
